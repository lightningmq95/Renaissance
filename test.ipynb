      "Speaker A: My gosh. You've already produced a PowerPoint presentation.\n",
      "Speaker B: I think it's already on actually. God, how do you make this thing work?\n",
      "Speaker C: You have to.\n",
      "Speaker B: Hello.\n",
      "Speaker C: Have you done that?\n",
      "Speaker B: I've plugged it in the back, but. Okay. Right. Okay. Right. Well, this is the kickoff meeting for our project and this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes. So first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other. I'm Laura and I'm the project manager.\n",
      "Speaker A: Great.\n",
      "Speaker B: Do you want to introduce yourself again?\n",
      "Speaker D: Hi, I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: And I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert.\n",
      "Speaker E: I'm Greg and I'm User interface.\n",
      "Speaker B: Great. Okay. So we're designing a new remote control. And. Oh, I have to record who's here actually. So that's David, Andrew and Craig. Isn't it? And you all arrived on time. Yes. We did design a new remote control. As you can see it's supposed to be original, trendy and user friendly. So that's kind of our brief. And so there are three different stages to the design. I'm not really sure what you guys have already received in your emails. What did you get?\n",
      "Speaker D: I just got the project announcement. Designing remote control.\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, that's what everybody got. Okay. So we're going to have like individual work and then a meeting about it and repeat that process three times. And at this point we get to try out the whiteboard over there. So you get to draw your favorite animal and sum up your favorite characteristics of it. So who would like to go first? Very good.\n",
      "Speaker A: All right. So this one here. Right. Okay. Very nice. All right. My favorite animal is like a beagle. Favorite characteristics of it. Is that right?\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker A: Right. Well, basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And yeah. They have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health. So this is Blue. Blue Beagle. My family's beagle.\n",
      "Speaker B: Right. Lovely.\n",
      "Speaker E: My favourite animal would be a monkey. The small. Cute and furry. And when Planet the Apes becomes real. I'm gonna be up there with.\n",
      "Speaker B: You can take as long over this as you like because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss. Okay. We do. We do. Don't feel like you're in a rush anyway.\n",
      "Speaker A: Actually told you a whole lot more about beagles.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay. Too. I might have to get you up again. I don't know what mine is. I'm gonna have to think on the spot. Now.\n",
      "Speaker A: Impressionist, can't draw.\n",
      "Speaker B: Is that a whale? Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker D: Well, my. I don't know. It's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head. Yes. Big reason is because I'm allergic to most animals. Allergic to animal first. So fish was a natural choice.\n",
      "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker D: And I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. They're quite harmless and mild and interesting.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay. I still don't know what I'm going to write about.\n",
      "Speaker A: Superb sketch, by the way.\n",
      "Speaker B: I was going to choose a dog as well, but I'll just draw a different kind of dog. My favorite animal is my own dog at home. That doesn't really look like him, actually. He looks more like a pig, actually.\n",
      "Speaker A: Oh, well, I see a dog in there.\n",
      "Speaker B: Do you? Oh, that's very good of you.\n",
      "Speaker A: Now I see a rooster. What kind is it?\n",
      "Speaker B: He's a mixture of various things. And what do I like about him? That's supposed to suggest that his tail wags. He's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you and very kind of affectionate and. And he's quite wee as well. So, you know, he doesn't take up too much space. And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well. This is quite amusing.\n",
      "Speaker A: Is he aware that this is his own tail that he's chasing?\n",
      "Speaker B: It is. I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of a sudden get up and start chasing his tail.\n",
      "Speaker A: Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned.\n",
      "Speaker B: Maybe. Where did you find this? Just down here. Okay, what are we doing next? Okay, we now need to discuss the project finance. So according to the brief, we're going to be selling this remote control for €25 and we're aiming to make 50 million euro. So we're going to be selling this on an international scale and we don't want it to cost any more than €1250. So 50% of the selling price.\n",
      "Speaker A: Can we just go over that again?\n",
      "Speaker B: Sure.\n",
      "Speaker A: So basically, all right, yeah. Okay, so cost, like production cost is all together 1250. But selling price is. Is that wholesale or retail, like on the shelf?\n",
      "Speaker B: I don't know. I imagine that's a good question.\n",
      "Speaker A: Our sale. Our sale.\n",
      "Speaker B: I imagine it probably is our sale, actually, because it's probably up to the. The retailer to sell it for whatever price they want. But I don't know. I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally. Will have a bearing on how we design it at all. Yes, I think it will.\n",
      "Speaker A: Right away. I'm wondering if there's, like with DVD players, if there are zones.\n",
      "Speaker B: Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Speaker A: Regions and stuff, frequencies or something.\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: As well as characters, different keypad styles and symbols.\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, well, for remote control, do you think that'll be? I suppose it depends on how complicated our remote control is.\n",
      "Speaker D: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view because you have more complicated characters, like European languages. Then you need more buttons.\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: And then. And then the other thing international, on the topic of price, I'm thinking the price might. Might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different.\n",
      "Speaker B: So what, just like, in terms of, like the wealth of the country, like how much money people have to spend.\n",
      "Speaker A: On things, or just like basic product positioning? A €25 remote control might be a big hit in London, might not be such a big hit in Greece, who knows?\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, marketing. Good marketing thoughts. Oh, gosh, I should be writing all this down.\n",
      "Speaker A: Right away. I'm making some kind of assumptions about what, what information we're given here, thinking, okay, trendy probably means something other than just basic. Yeah, something other than just standard. So I'm wondering right away, is selling €25, is that sort of. Is this going to be like the premium product?\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Like, how much does, you know, a remote control cost? Well, €25. I mean, that's. That's about like £18 or something, isn't it?\n",
      "Speaker A: Or.\n",
      "Speaker B: No. Is it as much as that? 16, 17, 18 pounds?\n",
      "Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say so. Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker B: I don't know. I've never bought a remote control, so I don't know how. How good a remote control that would get you, but yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky. Right, okay, let me just scoot on ahead here. Okay, well, does anybody have anything to add to the finance issue at all?\n",
      "Speaker A: Do we have any other background information on, like, how that compares to other.\n",
      "Speaker B: No, actually, that would be useful though, wouldn't it, if you knew, like, what your money would get you? No.\n",
      "Speaker A: The interesting thing about discussing production of remote control for me is that, as you point out, I just don't think remote control is being something. Something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something.\n",
      "Speaker B: Five minutes to end of meeting. Oh, okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: We're a bit behind, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, sort of like how do you, I mean, one, one way looking at it would be, well, the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls. Or another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something.\n",
      "Speaker E: My parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each house.\n",
      "Speaker A: Right.\n",
      "Speaker E: So for them it was just how many devices does it control?\n",
      "Speaker A: Right. So in function, one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses.\n",
      "Speaker B: Right. So do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control?\n",
      "Speaker A: I think so.\n",
      "Speaker B: Your satellite and your regular tally and your VCR and everything.\n",
      "Speaker A: Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of like an example of a successful other piece of technology is Palm Palm Pilots. They're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, MP3 players, telephones, everything agenda.\n",
      "Speaker C: So.\n",
      "Speaker A: So I wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house.\n",
      "Speaker B: Or even notes about what you want to watch, you might put in there. Oh, I want to watch such and such. That's a good idea. So extra functionalities.\n",
      "Speaker A: Personally, for me at home, I've combined the audio video of my television set and my DVD player and my CD player. So they all work actually function together. But I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that in their, you know, the sound and everything, it's just one system, but each one's got its own little part.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay, I'm gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes and I'll just check with nothing else. Okay. So anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls? They've used what they would really like to be part of this new one at all.\n",
      "Speaker D: You keep losing them.\n",
      "Speaker B: You keep losing them. Okay.\n",
      "Speaker D: Finding them is a major pain. I mean, it's usually quite small or when you want it, right. Sit behind the couch.\n",
      "Speaker B: Or you get those ones where you can, if you like whistle or make a really high pitched noise, they beep. I mean, is that something we'd want to include, do you think?\n",
      "Speaker A: Sure.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: Maybe I remember when the first remote control my, my family had was on a cable. Actually the cable between in the TV and big like buttons that sort of like like on a blender or something.\n",
      "Speaker B: My goodness.\n",
      "Speaker A: And you know, when I think about what they are now, it's better, but actually it's still kind of I don't know, like a massive junky thing on the table. Maybe we could think about how could be more, you know, streamlined.\n",
      "Speaker B: Maybe like a touchscreen or something.\n",
      "Speaker A: Something like that. Yeah. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. Okay, it could be that functionally, that doesn't make it any better, but that just the appeal of not having, you know, these days it's every few things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know, nicer materials and.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: Might be.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker A: Be worth exploring.\n",
      "Speaker B: Right. Well, so just to wrap up, the next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes. So that's about 10 to 12 by my watch. So in between now and then, as the industrial designer, you're going to be working on, you know, the actual working design of it. So you know, what you're doing there for user interface, technical functions, I guess that's, you know, like what we've been talking about, what it'll actually do. And marketing executive, you'll be just thinking about what it actually, you know, what requirements it has to fulfill and you'll all get instructions emailed to you, I guess.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. So it's. The functional design stage is next, I guess. And that's the end of the meeting. I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would.\n",
      "Speaker A: Before we wrap up, just to make sure we're on the same page here, do we. We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something.\n",
      "Speaker B: Right.\n",
      "Speaker A: Well, are we right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television, or are we keeping sort of like a design commitment to television features?\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay, well, just very quickly because we're supposed to finish. No, I guess that's up to us. I mean, you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker B: So, you know, one factor would be production cost.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker D: There's a cap there. So.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker D: Depends on how much you can cram into that price.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker B: Yeah, that's the main factor.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker B: Right. Okay. Well, that's the end of the meeting then. Thank you all for coming. God, I hope that was what they wanted us to do. Right, great. How do you turn this thing off? Function and. Ah, there we go. So I think if you can just leave it on maybe and then. Oh God, this has turned itself off.\n",
      "Speaker D: Try, try pushing the function and 8.\n",
      "Speaker C: I think.\n",
      "Speaker B: Oh, there it is. Thank goodness. Okay. Right.\n",
      "Speaker A: This is all very high tech, I must say.\n",
      "Speaker C: I don't know, like, do you guys go back to your where you're working so lots of unplugging. It's a good thing we. We don't have a catheter.\n",
      "Speaker A: Kind of what it feels like.\n",
      "Speaker C: Too many wires. I have to do a design project next semester. This is quite good training. It's a bad thing we do.\n",
      "Speaker D: What courses are you taking?\n",
      "Speaker C: Well, I'm talking about your sdp.\n",
      "Speaker D: Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker C: Computer Design, Alternating Systems.\n",
      "Speaker D: Next semester.\n",
      "Speaker C: Oh, next semester. Computer Security, Computer Architecture. And something else. I don't know. Sorry. Go.\n",
      "Speaker B: I don't know.\n",
      "Speaker C: I mean, I really know how it was supposed to go. Well, just.\n",
      "Speaker B: I wasn't expecting the five.\n"
